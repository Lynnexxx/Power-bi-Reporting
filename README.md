## About This Project

This repository presents a series of data analytics projects that highlight my ability to extract insights, build compelling dashboards, and support data-driven decisions using modern tools and techniques.

Technologies used across projects include:  
- Power BI – for interactive data visualization and dashboard development  
- SQL – for querying and transforming structured data  
- Excel – for data cleaning, aggregation, and quick analysis  
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – for cloud-based data processing and storage  

Each project is designed around a specific business case (e.g., loan portfolios, real estate market, customer segmentation), with clearly explained objectives, methodology, visuals, and insights.
